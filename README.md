# Solved-Error-notebook.notebook.app-Module-Not-Found

My Issue got resolved. I have tried to solve it using

"pip install notebook" and other commands but they didn't work for me.

This is how I got my issue resolved.

Download the Zip Folder from the provided link. [1]: https://github.com/Ali-Hasan-Khan28/Solved-Error-notebook.notebook.app-Module-Not-Found
Unzip the Folder and copy it.
Open anaconda3/Scripts folder in File Explorer.
Paste the Folder in anaconda3/Scripts.
Now try to open Jupyter Notebook. I hope it will work for you too.

If it works, I would be grateful if you follow me on Github :).
